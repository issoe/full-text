In a recent internet survey, tourists and business travellers 
were asked to rate 50 cities around the world, from the 
best  to the worst. Of the top three cities, two were in 
Europe and one was in Australia.
In third place was London, scoring highly mainly because 
it was the most famous city on the list of 50 surveyed. It 
was also seen as a very good place to do business, and 
was an important cultural centre. However, it lost points 
because people believed it was an extremely expensive 
place to live.
Sydney was also a very popular destination, achieving 
second place on the list because people believed it had 
the friendliest inhabitants, as well as the best standard 
of living and the nicest climate. It failed to make the top 
spot, however, because people thought there were very 
few things to see there, and many also thought it was too 
far away from other business and cultural centres. 
At the top of the list was Paris. Despite problems such 
as the large amount of traffic, it beat other cities to 
first place because people considered it to be the most 
interesting city, with more museums, art galleries and 
places of interest than anywhere else. People also thought 
it was the best city to take a holiday in.

The City Brands Index
The CBI believes that cities are like 1 
 
which people can buy when they go shopping.
Surveys take place every 2 
 .
A maximum of 3 
 cities are included in the 
survey.
A number of different 4 
 are included in 
the survey.
The CBI list is helpful for:
•  people who are trying to decide where to 
5 
 or get a job.
•  people who are looking for a good 6 
 
destination.
•  local 7 
 who want to make their city a 
better place.
A city survey with a dif erence
T ere are many websites on the Internet which provide lists of 
the world’s best cities to visit, live or work in. T ese lists usually 
grade the cities in order, from ‘best’ to ‘worst’, and are based on 
facts and f gures provided by local or national organisations.
T e City Brands Index (CBI) also provides a list of best and 
worst cities. However, unlike other surveys, it is based on the 
idea that cities are similar to products in shops. It asks ordinary 
people in other countries to grade cities in the same way that 
they would grade a product, like a sof  drink or a car. What is 
particularly dif erent about the CBI is that the people who take 
part in the survey may not have ever visited the cities. Instead, 
they are asked to say what they think the cities are like, basing 
their opinions on things like news stories, magazine articles or 
television programmes they have heard or seen.
Each year, about 10,000 people in 20 countries take part in 
the CBI survey, and they grade a total of 50 cities. T ey do 
this by f lling in an online questionnaire. T ere are several 
categories in the survey. T ese include things like the economy, 
education, the environment, local culture, climate and what 
the city’s residents are like. 
T e CBI list is useful because it helps people choose a good 
place to live, f nd work or take a holiday. 
It also helps regional governments to 
understand why people and businesses 
are, or are not, coming to their cities, 
and so shows them areas which they 
could develop or improve.
