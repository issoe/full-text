1. Construct regular expressions expressing languages over {a, b, c}, in which for every string w it holds that
a. Strings made by a’s only (can be empty)
b. Any strings made by {a, b, c}
c. The number of a’s in w is even
d. There are (4i + 1) b’s in w (i >= 0)
2. Develop a CFG to represent a single declaration in C++.
The type can be int and xed array (i.e number of element is an integer constant) of int t. The non-array variables
can be with/without default values.
Example: int a, b = 2, c[4];
Assume that the following tokens have been dened by the lexer.

3. Given a context-free grammar as follows.
E → E + T|E–T|E/F|T
T → T ∗ F|F
F → (E)|Int
a. Draw the parse tree for the following expression.
2 + 3 ∗ 5 − 4
2 + (3 ∗ 5 − 4)
b. Compare the precedence between * and – operators. Prove your answer.
c. What are the association of 4 operators? Prove your answers.
4. Show that the following grammars is ambigous
S → AB|aaB
A → a|aA
B → b
