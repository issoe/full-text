Abstract: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are transferrable rights to digital assets, such as images, videos, or 
music. The phenomenon and its markets have grown significantly since early 2021. The number of NFT 
marketplaces has been rising continuously since a couple of years. Majority of them employ centralized 
systems for storage of digital assets (files). This is contradictory to the notion of decentralized systems. In this 
project we propose a secure platform for trading digital assets in the form of Non-Fungible tokens. It will 
enable the users to create new digital assets and trade them in exchange of Ethereum-based cryptocurrency. 
Along with this, we aim to explore technical feasibility of a decentralized file system (using IPFS protocol) 
for storing the digital assets in a more secured way. In this way, we attempt to address the issue of file storage. 
Also, this project is an attempt to advocate the use of block chain technology. 
 
Keywords: NFT, Blockchain, Ethereum, IPFS, Decentralized Networks 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
   Technology advancement and digitization were not always regarded as partners in the evolution of the arts industry. This 
viewpoint and mindset are about to shift. With their involvement in various Non-Fungible Token projects, content creators, 
artists, and personalities from a variety of industries have dominated the headlines. This turning away from traditional 
business models has been accomplished by recognizing the powerful tools and innovative features provided by blockchain 
technology. The usability of such technology has been directly proportional to the curve of discovery of novel business 
concepts involving tokens and tokenization processes.

III. BACKGROUND AND BASICS 
    A Non-Fungible Token is essentially a digital certificate of authenticity that cannot be copied. NFTs are used to represent 
ownership of unique items and are stored on a blockchain or distributed ledger. Because of the secure properties of 
blockchain technology, the record of ownership is always available, immutable, and guarantees that only one owner can 
exist at any given time. 
    NFTs, which are based on the blockchain programmable infrastructure, can represent anything that is both physical and 
digital in a digital realm. It is critical to recognise that the metadata stored within the Token's smart contract ensures 
uniqueness and, together with the transparency of the transaction history provided by the underlying technology, allows the 
NFT to be verifiable by any network participant, reducing the risk of counterfeiting to zero.

4.5 Business Rules 
 
Conduct Code: Most NFTs, given the predominance of user-generated content and transactions in NFT 
marketplaces, include an extra layer of legal restrictions in the form of codes of conduct to govern interactions on 
the platform. 
 
Smart Contracts: The unique digital creation must be independently identifiable, with ownership transferable 
within the smart contract. Creators should design-in the economics of trading:  How much for a primary sale, how 
much for secondary sales, royalties, transaction costs and other features of the aftermarket to enable trading, with 
funds flowing to the appropriate parties by design. 
 
Platform Terms of Service: NFT marketplaces must have essential documents such as Terms of Service, which 
govern the relationship between the NFT marketplace operator and customers, and between the buyers and sellers 
of the NFTs featured on the platform. A well-thought-out terms of service agreement can help protect the 
organization from various legal issues and generally have provisions limiting the company’s overall liability. 
 
Terms of Sale: Sellers or creators listing their NFTs on an NFT marketplace may wish to impose additional terms 
of sale on purchasers of their NFT, especially if the platform’s terms of service do not sufficiently address risks to 
the seller or creator. 
 
Intellectual Property Protection: It is vital to verify each participant’s intellectual property rights through each step 
of every NFT transaction. Be sure to allocate intellectual property rights between the creators/artists,

purchasers/collectors, and other parties involved. The ownership of the original work is copyright ownership, which 
vests in the creator of the original work. If an NFT is minted and sold, the purchaser will receive a set of intellectual 
property rights from the creator as part of owning the NFT. The seller of the NFT determines the rights that 
accompany an NFT. 
 
Payments: If payments are processed on behalf of counter parties, the party touching the money may be a “money 
transmitter” with its activities governed by applicable Treasury, state and local registration regulations.  To avoid 
the complex process of registration in innumerable jurisdictions, many marketplaces partner with already-
registered entities, acting as content creators rather than payment processors.  
 
Data Privacy: Being transparent about the data collection and use is critical. Many jurisdictions require platforms 
to disclose their data practices in a privacy policy. The fines for privacy violations can be significant. 
 
4.6 Project Process Modelling 
    Agile project management is an iterative approach to delivering a project throughout its life cycle. Iterative or agile life 
cycles are composed of several iterations or incremental steps towards the completion of a project. Iterative approaches are 
frequently used in software development projects to promote velocity and adaptability since the benefit of iteration is that 
you can adjust as you go along rather than following a linear path. One of the aims of an agile or iterative approach is to 
release benefits throughout the process rather than only at the end. At the core, agile projects should exhibit central values 
and behaviours of trust, flexibility, empowerment and collaboration 
 
V. LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS 
    As of the time of writing this, cryptocurrency is not a legal tender in many countries [5]. Users need to be aware of all the 
risks [6] involved while investing in assets. The authors are not responsible at any given time if any anomalies with the 
finances that might happen if proper attention is not paid.  
    Users need to load up digital currency onto their existing wallet from 3rd party exchanges like Binance, WazirX, FTX, 
etcetera. The project is a technical demonstration on how ERC-721 tokens can be traded for digital currency in a modern 
age web-based application. 
 
VI. SAFETY REQUIREMENTS 
    The blockchain provides the protection and transferability enabled by distributed ledger technology. Representing 
anything from tweets to real estate - NFTs are ultimately digital collectibles. NFT's are different from other blockchain-
based assets like Bitcoin, Ether, and stable coins that are identical, interchangeable, and ultimately fungible. This is because 
NFT's represent non-fungible, divisible, and transferable pieces of ownership in distinct assets. 
 
Avoiding Duplicity: To prevent fraudulent users from uploading same file in the marketplace, a database keeps 
track of all data that goes into the inventory and prompts user an error if duplicity is found. 
 
Transaction atomicity: The atomicity of transaction should be maintained so that the users don’t lose their currency 
or assets in the event of transaction failure. 
 
Returning Auction Funds: Users that participate in auctions need to keep the cryptocurrency staked at said price 
on hold until the auction ends. Once this ends, the winner of the auction is compensated with the NFT to his/her 
wallet. And rest of the funds that were put on hold shall be released to where it came from. 
 
Data Redundancy: Databases should use sharding to be redundant to prevent loss of data. Backups of the databases 
should be done hourly and be kept for one week. 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
    Non-Fungible Token (NFT) is a new technology that is gaining traction in the blockchain market. In this report, we look 
at cutting-edge NFT solutions that could reshape the digital/virtual asset market in the future. We begin by analysing the 
technical components and then provide design models and properties. Then, we assess the security of current NFTs systems 
and go over the opportunities and potential applications that use the NFT concept. Finally, we outline current research 
challenges that must be addressed before reaching mass-market penetration. We hope that this report provides timely 
analysis and summaries of existing proposed solutions and projects, making it easier for newcomers to stay current.
